🧵 THREAD START

[1/9]
"Nothing passes unverified."

LLMs like ChatGPT hallucinate — confidently.

In professional work (client reports, exec communications, pitches), that's a liability.

Here's a framework to catch it: GroundedGate Protocol (GGP)

5 markers. 4 tiers. 8-point validation.

Let me explain ↓

[2/9]
THE PROBLEM

ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini can generate text that SOUNDS authoritative but is completely fabricated.

The confident tone + professional formatting hide the hallucinations until they reach your client, your boss, or a regulator.

How we stop it: Make verification VISIBLE.

[3/9]
THE 5 MARKERS

[CONFIRMED] ← Fact verified with source + tier. Always cite.

[INFERENCE] ← Assumption made. User must accept/reject.

[GAP] ← Missing info. Must be filled before delivery.

[UNVERIFIED] ← Couldn't verify OR weak source. Flag it.

[RISK] ← Legal/reputation concern. Describe explicitly.

[4/9]
THE 4-TIER SOURCE SYSTEM

TIER 1 (Gold): SEC filings, government data, peer-review journals, court documents
→ Use as primary evidence

TIER 2 (Solid): FT, WSJ, McKinsey, Gartner
→ Verify if critical; cross-reference

TIER 3 (Moderate): General news, expert blogs, company sites, Wikipedia
→ Cross-ref recommended

TIER 4 (Low): Forums, social media, blogs, outdated (>2yr)
→ NEVER mark as CONFIRMED

[5/9]
THE HARD RULE

Tier 4 sources CANNOT produce [CONFIRMED].

Ever.

This is non-negotiable for professional credibility.

If your source is weak, it's either [UNVERIFIED] or [INFERENCE] or it needs a Tier 1-2 corroboration.

No shortcuts.

[6/9]
3-PHASE COMPLIANCE CYCLE

1️⃣ LOAD RULES ← Read markers, tiers, prohibited language, Devil's Advocate

2️⃣ LOAD CHANNEL ← Identify target (email, LinkedIn, presentation, etc.)

3️⃣ CREATE + VALIDATE ← Tag all facts, run Devil's Advocate (5 mandatory checks), 8-point validation gate

Result: Clean output ready to send.

[7/9]
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (5 Mandatory Checks)

1. MISINTERPRETATION — Could this be read differently?
2. CREDIBILITY — Anything unfounded or weakly sourced?
3. LEGAL — Any claim that creates liability?
4. REPUTATION — Could this damage your professional image?
5. DATA ACCURACY — Any statistics that could be challenged?

If risk score ≥9: Human review before proceeding.

OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP TWEETS (Post after main thread):

[FOLLOW-UP A]
Quick question: Have you caught an LLM hallucination in professional work?

If yes, what was it and where would GGP have caught it?

Reply in thread — I want to hear your war stories.

[FOLLOW-UP B]
One thing people ask: "Does GGP take longer?"

Answer: Initially yes (learning curve ~30 min).

Then no. Because you spend LESS time on back-and-forth review, revisions, and "wait, is this true?" moments.

Faster overall. More confident. Risk managed.
