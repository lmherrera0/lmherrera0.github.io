│ The Hallucination Problem Is Real—And It's Costing Us         │
│                                                                 │
│ I recently worked with a team that used ChatGPT to draft a    │
│ client proposal. The AI sounded perfect—specific data points, │
│ competitor references, market timing. The CEO was ready to    │
│ send.                                                          │
│                                                                 │
│ Then a colleague verified one claim. It was fabricated.        │
│                                                                 │
│ Lucky catch. Because if that proposal had reached the client  │
│ with made-up data, it would have cost the relationship and    │
│ credibility.                                                   │
│                                                                 │
│ This isn't rare. It's the new normal. LLMs hallucinate         │
│ confidently and frequently.                                    │
│                                                                 │
│ So how do we use LLMs for professional work without this risk? │
│                                                                 │

│ Challenge: Your team uses ChatGPT/Claude for client work, but  │

│ It takes ~30 min to learn the basics:                          │
│ • 5 markers to classify claims                                │
│ • 4 tiers to evaluate sources                                 │

│ Then your team applies it to: email, proposals, reports,      │

│ What changes:                                                  │
│ ✓ Faster review cycles (clearer what's verified vs. not)     │
│ ✓ Lower risk (hallucinations flagged before shipping)        │
│ ✓ Better credibility (reasoning visible to clients)           │
│ ✓ More confidence (team knows the system)                     │
│                                                                 │
