## 📋 WHY THIS MATTERS

The downloadable templates are **context-agnostic by design**.

This means they work for:

- ✓ Client deliverables

- ✓ Regulatory submissions
- ✓ Academic presentations
- ✓ Vendor partnerships
- ✓ Executive briefings
- ✓ Marketing/sales materials

**No one needs to know your specific use case.** The framework is universal.
